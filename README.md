## Introduction

The Shabad OS Presenter is a GPL-licensed open source project with ongoing development, project management, and marketing made possible entirely by the support and dedication of unpaid volunteers.

This app can be used to display bani & gurbani in the home or at the gurdwara. A server model allows multiple devices to act as a display or a controller. The same model enables live captions to be in sync with the projector / presentation device.

Helpful features were added over years of production-ready use.
