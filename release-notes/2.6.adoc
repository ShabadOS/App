.*Update 2.6.1*
* Fixed a bug with the up/down gui buttons in navigator causing a crash or not working
____

Welcome to the {release} release of {repo-title}. There are a number of updates we hope you will like, some of the key highlights include:

* <<Replace Line of Line with Info Button>> - Provides information about the current line in the shabad, options to open the line in the online database viewer (mostly for accuracy reviewers), and a copy shabad button.
* <<New presentation overlays>> - Added two presentation overlays for use during stay-at-home covid19 live streams without webcam/video. See "cinematic presentation" and "floating presentation" overlays.
* <<Wrapped Lines>> - Every panel/activity (search, history, bookmarks, navigator) will no longer truncate text. (i.e. prevents gurbani from being hidden by ellipsis).

## Notes

* Logo was updated to remove the circular white background
* Vishraam symbols are no longer included in copy

## Controller

### Replace Line of Line with Info Button

The "_Line of Line_" text between the up and down GUI buttons for navigator has been replaced with an info button that provides information for the currently selected line, a way to review the line in the online db viewer, and a method to copy the entire shabad.

### Wrapped Lines

Previously matched search queries could be hidden by truncated gurbani text. This release makes all text wrappable to the next line(s) so that information is not hidden away.

## Settings

### New presentation overlays

Two new overlays have been added for easy live streaming without a webcam/video feed. Subscribe to the https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8UjVV2Lz8H8J2Cka6iVsA/[Shabad OS YouTube channel] for guides.
